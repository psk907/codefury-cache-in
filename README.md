Nowkri is an app that aims to provide a simple, transparent job-hunting experience while also delivering a level of job safety in the world recovering and following the pandemic.

Targeting job-seekers in the unorganised sector, we aim to make them feel included and secure rather than solely focusing on white-collar jobs that market leaders like LinkedIn target.

This app was developed in 24 hours for my team's participation in [IEEE UVCE's CodeFury 3.0. ](https://codefury2020.herokuapp.com/)
